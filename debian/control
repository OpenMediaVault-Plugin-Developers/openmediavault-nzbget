Description: command-line based binary newsgrabber for nzb files
 NZBGet is a command-line based binary newsgrabber that uses nzb files as
 described in http://docs.newzbin.com/index.php/Newzbin:NZB_Specs, they are
 commonly used to describe binaries posted in the Usenet that span multiple
 posts.
 .
 nzbget can be run as a standalone tool, in client/server mode or as a daemon,
 which makes it ideal to run on NAS-devices or routers. nzbget supports
 automatic par-check/-repair can use scripts to postprocess downloaded files,
 for example to stream them to an audio/video player.
